## Exercise on Real Time Bus Tracker
In this project, I have created a real-time bus tracker. It runs an animation of a marker representing all of the bus stops in between MIT and Harvard.
## How to Run
1. Downloads each file and store them into one folder.
2. Open an empty browser and drag index.html into the browser.
## Roadmap
I will update more stops and lines in the future.
